# Variables

A "variable" is a place where you can store information, such as a string, or a number. A variable has a _name_ (that you choose) and a _value_. New variables in JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: `let`, `const`, or `var`.

## Variable declaration

Variables are "declared" using the `var`, `let` or `const` keyword. In the following example three variables are declared with the names `x`, `foo` and `bar`.

```js
var x;
let foo;
const bar;
```

Note that the chosen names in this example are meaningless (perhaps with the exception of `x`, for instance as part of a mathematical program). You should make an effort to always choose names that best describe what you intend this variable to hold.

## var

Prior to JavaScript ES6 the `var` keyword was the only way to declare a variable. ES6 introduced two new keywords, `let` and `const` for declaring variables. They improve on how the older `var` declaration works (this involves the concept of "scope" that you will learn about in the third lecture). In HackYourFuture we encourage you to use the more modern `let` and `const` keywords over `var`, but you will often come across `var` in existing books, software libraries and examples on the Internet, so you should understand `var` too.

## let and const
- read about [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
- read about [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
- [let vs const] (http://wesbos.com/let-vs-const/)

Here, we say: "declare variable x and initialize it with the integer (number) 6".

```js
let foo;  // declare variable `foo`
```

```js
let foo = 6; // declare and assign a variable at the same time
```

You can also assign a value to an existing variable:
```js
foo = 4;  // change variable `foo`
```
